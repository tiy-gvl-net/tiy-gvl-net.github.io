    <p>All students must bring their own laptop running Windows 10. Your laptop should have a minimum of 4 GB of RAM and 128 GB of hard
drive space. Those are minimum specs, and I recommend getting 8 GB of RAM and a 256 GB hard drive, but that’s your
choice to make. If you already own a laptop and it’s older than that, send me an email and we can talk.</p>

<p>Your laptop must be running Windows 10.</p>

<p>As soon as possible after receiving your laptop, run through the following steps. If you’ve done a lot of your own
configuration, some of these steps may have to change.  If you run into ANY PROBLEMS, send me an e-mail at:</p>

<p>joel@theironyard.com</p>

<p>Again, we want to have all of these kinks worked out in advance, so PLEASE e-mail if things don’t work as described below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install Windows 10, if you haven’t already.
    <ol>
      <li>If your laptop doesn't already have Windows 10 installed, you may have to upgrade. An upgrade can be purchased from any major
      retailer of office supplies or software.</li>
      <li>You can also purchase a downloadable upgrade <a href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100?icid=CatPage_Win10_DualCTA_102516">here</a></li>
      <li>If you require use of any assistive technology - Microsoft grants you a free upgrade to Windows 10. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/windows10upgrade">Click here to get started.</a></li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> The Windows 10 can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Install Visual Studio
    <ol>
      <li>Download Visual Studio Community 2015 from <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/post-download-vs/?sku=community&clcid=0x409&telem=ga">the Visual Studio website</a>.</li>
      <li>Run the installer and follow the instructions to install.</li>
      <li>It can take a while to install - so clear your schedule.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  That should get you ready to start your first few days of class!
