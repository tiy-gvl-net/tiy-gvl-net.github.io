      <p>Welcome to the .NET class at The Iron Yard in Greenville! We are going to have a very exciting cohort.  Before class, you’re going to need to do a few things to get ready:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/setup.html">Get and setup your Computer</a></li>
    <li><a href="/syllabus.html">Read through the syllabus</a></li>
    <li><a href="/prework.html">Complete your prework</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The prework will take you quite some time – probably around 40 hours, maybe more. So don’t wait until the last minute to start it. It is due one week before class.</p>
