<h2 id="introduction" class="clickable-header top-level-header">Introduction</h2><i class="icon-arrow-up back-to-top"> </i>

<p>There are quite a few tasks and learning topics that are necessary to take care of before we can actually start
learning how to be developers. Rather than using class time to get through these, I expect that you can accomplish
and learn these things without assistance so that we can spend class time only on those things that are difficult
to learn on your own. That being said, feel free to email me if you have any questions.</p>

<p>We don’t believe you can really learn to program by watching a few videos and answering some questions (and if you
believed that, you probably wouldn’t be coming to The Iron Yard). However, skill acquisition takes a long time, and
this work will help introduce you to some of the ideas and skills that will form the foundation of your in-person
learning experience.</p>

<p>This work should be completed by January 2nd. I will assume that you have completed this work before class, so you will
likely feel very far behind if you haven’t finished when we start class on January 9th. If you have ANY questions at all,
please reach out to me at joel@theironyard.com.</p>

<h2 id="objectives" class="clickable-header top-level-header">Objectives</h2><i class="icon-arrow-up back-to-top"> </i>

<p>The following are the learning objectives for this prework, all of which are important requirements expected of a
professional developer. Although only a subset are technically “programming” skills, they are  important to success
both during the class and on the job.</p>

<p>The prework should assure us that you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reflect on your own mental processes, preferences, and struggles</li>
  <li>Communicate information about yourself and about technical accomplishments clearly</li>
  <li>Manage your learning time effectively (and avoid procrastination)</li>
  <li>Adopt workflows used by professional developers</li>
  <li>Acquire new skills at a rapid pace</li>
</ul>

<p>Not surprisingly, you will continue to work towards these objectives throughout the course.</p>

<h2 id="accounts" class="clickable-header top-level-header">Accounts</h2><i class="icon-arrow-up back-to-top"> </i>

<h3 id="github" class="clickable-header">GitHub</h3>

<p>GitHub is a web-based hosting and communication service for software development projects that uses the Git revision
control system.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sign up for an account at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name, since this will help me learn your name and face.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="mva" class="clickable-header">Microsoft Virtual Academy</h3>

<p>Microsoft has their own site containing many resources to not only get started on your journey of learning
to code but also to continue to learn new materials when you're comfortable with your newly gained knowledge.
Signing up for a virtual academy account is free and is also not required to view the videos.</p>

<p>If you already have a microsoft account you can use it to log in and use MVA but if you don't have an account
you can sign up <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="mde" class="clickable-header">Microsoft Dev Essentials</h3>

<p>Microsoft has created a program you can sign up for that enables "educational" access to many of their
flagship products. Registering for Dev Essentials is not a requirement of this class but it can enable
access to a number of products, namely: Monthly Credit for Azure, Xamarin University (for building mobile apps) to name a few.</p>

<p>To sign up for a Dev Essentials account, or to login with your Microsoft account go to <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/dev-essentials/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="topic-2-visual-studio" class="clickable-header top-level-header">Topic 2: Visual Studio</h2><i class="icon-arrow-up back-to-top"> </i>

<p><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/post-download-vs/?sku=community&clcid=0x409&telem=ga">Visual Studio Community 2015</a> is the Integrated Development Environment we utilize in our classroom. It it because of this program
that we are required to use the Windows Operating system. C# and .NET are moving in a direction that will not be so tightly connected to
the Microsoft ecosystem but learning how to use Visual Studio to write software will serve you very well in your development career.
</p>

<p>You can download a copy and begin the install process with the link above.  The install can take as few as 1 but as many as 3 hours to install - so you may want to clear your schedule.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In order to get more familiar with the environment here is a video to get you started with installing.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="topic-3-cs" class="clickable-header top-level-header">Topic 3: C#</h2><i class="icon-arrow-up back-to-top"> </i>

<p>We will be covering the fundamentals of C# in detail in our class, but having a shared vocabulary from the
beginning is essential to us quickly jumping in.</p>

<ol>
  <li>On our first day we will hit the ground sprinting. You should be comfortable with the very basics of the C# programming
  language. In order to have some familiarity with our first few topics you should go through the following videos and make sure you
  are comfortable with the material covered.</li>
  <li>Start with this <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=p90QdGQIC_7106218949">as your first C# program:</a></li>
  <li>Continue through the content as far as you want / are able to, but at a minimum make sure you at least make it to section 15. Understanding Classes.</li>
  <li><a href="http://learncs.org/">Learn CS (C#)</a>There are a few topics written that you should read through and try the challenges.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="topic-4-git" class="clickable-header top-level-header">Topic 4: Git</h2><i class="icon-arrow-up back-to-top"> </i>

<p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very
large projects with speed and efficiency.</p>

<p>It is a command line tool that we will be using for every project we do in class. Again, the objective is not to
become an expert before the class, but just to start to get comfortable.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Do the <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">Try Git</a> Exercises</li>
  <li>Read some of the <a href="https://guides.github.com/">GitHub Guides</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>Hello World</li>
      <li>Getting Your Project on GitHub</li>
      <li>Understanding the GitHub flow</li>
      <li>Forking Projects</li>
      <li>Mastering Markdown</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="topic-5-htmlcss" class="clickable-header top-level-header">Topic 5: HTML/CSS</h2><i class="icon-arrow-up back-to-top"> </i>

<p>Almost done.  Although we’re not going to talk about them in the first few weeks of class, HTML and CSS are the
foundation of all the content of a webpage or web app. This will help get you primed so that we can keep our
momentum when we shift from pure C# to Web Development.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Complete the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web">Codecademy Web track</a>.</li>

<p>Whew, you did it. Now, your only remaining assignment is to get some sleep before class starts. You’re going to need it!</p>
